### Online Lesson Management System

#### General Description
This project focuses on the development of an **Online Lesson Management System** tailored for freelance professionals. The platform aims to eliminate commission fees charged by existing platforms and foster a direct relationship between teachers and students. The primary goal is to create an independent platform that enables professionals to offer personalized teaching services without intermediaries. This approach ensures lower costs for students while guaranteeing teachers the full revenue from their lessons, encouraging competitive and accessible pricing.

Unlike platforms such as "Apprentus" or "GoStudent," which deduct significant commissions, often reducing teachers' earnings and forcing higher lesson prices, this system simplifies the direct connection between teachers and students, ensuring transparency and affordability.

#### Key Actors
- **Freelance Professional (System Administrator):** Manages the system, schedules lessons, sets prices, applies discounts, and interacts with users.
- **Registered User (Client):** Accesses the system to book lessons, purchase packages, and provide feedback.
- **Visitor:** Non-registered user who can explore information about the system and available services.

### System Features

#### User Side
